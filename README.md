This **electra-one** package, is a toolset for my use-case with a Access Virus TI synthesizer and the Electra One MIDI controller. It contains the *Preset File* to be loaded into the Electra One. This will on itself allow for editing **Part 1** on the Access Virus TI. As there are many parameters just for 1 part (The Virus TI has 16 parts) all the available screens on the ELectra One (12) are needed just for this part alone. To overcome this limitation (only 1 part), I created this toolset, which copntains what I call a *router*, that will allow all remaining parts to be edited as well. Here is how it works:

## Initial setup

As this package is writen as a NodeJS module, the following initial setup is required:
- NodeJS is installed. The download + instructions can be found here: https://nodejs.org/
- Installing this toolset can be done by running `npm install -g electra-one` on the command line. This has been tested on MacOS (on which I created this package), and on a Raspberry PI B+, which is where this toolset runs in my setup.
