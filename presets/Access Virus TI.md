# Access Virus TI (v1.0.1)

This *Preset File* on itself will allow editing of all parameters of part 1.  It will be bi-directional, as it allows for requests of entire (Single Dump) presets, and recognises the response, and maps them to all the parameters.

This Preset will really shine when used in conjunction with the **electra-one router**, which is a command-line router (tested on MacOS and Raspberry PI), that does the routing and forwarding a bit clever, such that the actual **Part** can be chosen on the Electra One console (first page, top right). See for the full description here: [https://github.com/jorisroling/electra-one](https://github.com/jorisroling/electra-one)

**IMPORTANT**: This Preset assumes you have set your Access Virus TI to MIDI Device ID to Omni.

**MIND YOU**: This Preset is assuming you have your Access Virus connected via Electra One's port 2. Please adapt to your liking.

**Changelog:**

**v1.0.1** (22-06-2021)
The initial release was only working if you've set your Access Virus to MIDI Device ID 1. I had that but forgot about it. Only because my Virus' battery recently died (after 14 years of service!), I found that the default is actualy 'Omni' (meaning 'any'). So this release of the Preset has all SysEx set to 'Omni'.

**v1.0** (23-04-2021)
Initial release
