This *Preset File* on itself will allow editing of all parameters of part 1.  It will be bi-directional, as it allows for requests of entire (Single Dump) presets, and recognises the response, and maps them to all the parameters.

This Preset will really shine when used in conjunction with the **electra-one router**, which is a command-line router (tested on MacOS and Raspberry PI), that does the routing and forwarding a bit clever, such that the actual **Part** can be chosen on the Electra One console (first page, top right).
